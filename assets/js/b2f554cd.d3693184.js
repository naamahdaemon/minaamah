(All my nodes are upgraded already obviously !)\\n\\n**On June, 4th**\\n\\n* **STEP 1**\\n\\nNo specific action is required until the stop network slot is reached (**14:00 UTC**). At least one node must still be active and connected to the network until the stop slot is reached (ideally, all nodes of an operator can remain online). The calculation of uptime will be taken into account until the stop slot is reached (**14:00 UTC**).\\n\\n* **STEP 2**\\n\\nUntil the upgrade package is released (**20:00 UTC**): No action required.\\n\\n* **STEP 3**\\n\\nOnce the upgrade package is available: All operators update and restart their nodes (**20:00 UTC - 00:00 UTC**). Uptime calculation will resume at **00:01 UTC** with a tolerance until **01:01 UTC**.\\n\\n:::note\\nDuring this period, no block will be produced.\\n:::\\n\\n* **STEP 4**\\n\\nFrom 00:00 UTC, the blockchain will restart on Berkeley fully operational: block production, snarks production, uptime, ...\\n\\n\\n# What\'s next ?\\n\\nAfter the Hard Fork (if all goes well):\\n\\n* The end of supercharged blocks will result in a decrease in profitability but will also level the playing field for all serious validators. It will also reduce the number of new tokens created, which will limit the inflationary nature of the token (and that\'s a good thing).\\n\\n* As a delegator, it will be important to ensure that your validator is up-to-date with their nodes from now on (version 2.0.0) until the update is triggered and their validation nodes are updated, otherwise, they will operate a zombie chain that will no longer produce valid rewards (for you). I encourage everyone to contact their validator to ensure they are up-to-date and that everything is in order for the update on 06/04.\\n\\nFinally, there will certainly be impacts on tools, explorers, and websites concerning Mina. Some blockchain explorers may experience disruptions or become non-functional or display inconsistent information. Other services will be completely stopped (e.g., Mina Explorer\'s GraphQL APIs), which may also cause interruptions to some services that use them (my site, for example, uses the Mina Explorer GraphQL API, which I will have to replace eventually to display produced blocks, delegations, and payouts).\\n\\nIn summary, be patient, do not hesitate to contact your validator if you have any questions or problems, and do not panic if the rewards for the epoch post-hard fork take a little time to arrive \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**This update is going to be epic. It is important to realize the amount of work and investment that goes into not only updating but also synchronizing all the actors, which are ultimately the key to the success of updating a fully decentralized application.**"},{"id":"Epoch 78 Payouts","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Epoch 78 Payouts","editUrl":"https://github.com/naamahdaemon/minaamah/tree/main/blog/2024-05-31-epoch-78-payouts/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-31-epoch-78-payouts/index.md","title":"Epoch 78 Payouts","description":"Epoch 78 payouts may be a little late this Time.","date":"2024-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 31, 2024","tags":[{"label":"mina","permalink":"/blog/tags/mina"},{"label":"payouts","permalink":"/blog/tags/payouts"},{"label":"epoch","permalink":"/blog/tags/epoch"}],"readingTime":0.53,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Naamah","title":"Administrator","url":"https://github.com/naamahdaemon","imageURL":"https://github.com/naamahdaemon.png","key":"naamah"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Epoch 78 Payouts","title":"Epoch 78 Payouts","authors":["naamah"],"tags":["mina","payouts","epoch"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Mina Hard Fork coming","permalink":"/blog/Mina Hard Fork"},"nextItem":{"title":"Epoch 75 Payouts","permalink":"/blog/Epoch 75 Payouts"}},"content":"Epoch 78 payouts may be a little late this Time.\\n\\nAs you surely know already, the Mina Hard-Fork (dedicated blog post to come) will occur on June, 4th in only 4 days !!\\n\\nEpoch 78 ends the same day (around 3AM) few hours before the network stops for 15 hours (starting at 9AM until 12AM on June, 5th).\\n\\nFor this reason, payouts may be a little bit delayed this epoch.\\n\\nUntil now 7 blocks have been won (on 11 assigned block production slots).
