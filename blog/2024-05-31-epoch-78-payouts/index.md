# Epoch 78 payouts sent
Epoch 78 payouts may be a little late this Time.

As you surely know already, the Mina Hard-Fork (dedicated blog post to come) will occur on June, 4th in only 4 days !!

Epoch 78 ends the same day (around 3AM) few hours before the network stops for 15 hours (starting at 9AM until 12AM on June, 5th).

For this reason, payouts may be a little bit delayed this epoch.

Until now 7 blocks have been won (on 11 assigned block production slots). That's better than last epoch ðŸ˜‰

As a reminder, you can find all payouts in realtime on this page :
