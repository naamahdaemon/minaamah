# Payout Calculator updated
The payout calculator has been updated and delivers consistant results again for the new chain (forked from the old one) :  

* [Payouts](</docs/Node Statistics/payouts>)

You'll find also additional realtime information on my Block Producer here :  

* [Block Production](</docs/Node Statistics/block_production>)
* [Delegations](</docs/Node Statistics/delegations>)

:::note
The payout calculator may not output the exact same results as the payout script.  
Rules for computing payout have changed (no more supercharged, no more burn, ..) and thus some discrepancies may occur between my computations and those from the payout script.   
Again, mine are provided for information only. Only reference are the results of the payout script.
