# Mina Payout Simulator
Have you ever wondered if your validator's performance was as good as you expected?  
How does it compare with other validators?  
What if you could compare it to another validator based on real epoch data?  

:::question
**How much would you have received if you had delegated to X instead of Y for this epoch?**
!!!

Stop tormenting yourself! Now you can compare your validator's performance with mine (or any other validator)!!

I've made this tool available to you.
