# Some news about my BP
Hello There !  
Epoch 7 recently ended.  

This was a "bad" epoch unfortunately.  

Only 2 production slots were assigned at the VRF lottery and on these 2 production slots only the first block was included into the canonical chain.  
This means only 1 block was produced this epoch resulting in much lower-than-expected rewards, with an APY of just 1.74%.

Overall, my BP performance is still strong, with an average APY of 10.62%. We can expect a better outcome in Epoch 8, as 7 slots have been assigned for this epoch.  
While it's not the highest number of slots ever assigned to my BP, it's much better than the previous one.

Below is the evolution of my BP performance since the start of the hard fork (you can display and compare it with other BPs using my validator comparison tool as always : https://mina.naamahdaemon.eu/payout-simulator)

# Minacon
On October 21-23, **Minacon** will take place in Istanbul.  
It will be a great opportunity to bring together amazing people who are deeply involved in the Mina community, to meet, share, exchange ideas, and gather Mina developers under one roof in order to

ü§ù Foster ecosystem collaborations  
üí•	Address blockers and outstanding questions  
üåÄ	Develop understanding to support ecosystem growth  

Minacon is an *unconference* ‚Äî where participants choose the topics. It focuses on the best part of traditional conferences: the hallway conversations.

It will bring together bright minds, with laptops open, taking practical steps toward each other's near-term goals.

Many incredible people will attend Minacon, and I‚Äôm proud to be one of them.

Here is a list of some of the amazing attendees:
