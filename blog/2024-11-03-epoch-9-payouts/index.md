# Epoch 9 payouts
Hello There !  
Epoch 9 recently ended.  

3 blocks were produced on 6 slots assigned.
Not the best epoch so far.

Epoch 10 should be better with 11 slots assigned and already 4 blocks produced.

You may have noticed something special happened during epoch 9.  
My BP produced a block including a delegation transaction with a huge erroneous amount of fees (27477 minas !!).  

You can see this transaction in this block :

Of course, it was an error from the delegator who thought he should specify the amount to be delegated in the fees.
I returned the funds to the sender (Being honest as a BP is not an option).

It means that fees will not be shared amongst delegators for epoch 9 (as I would have to pay more than 27000 mina from my own wallet !).  It does not make a big difference though as fees are most of the time very low.

Compare it with other BPs using my validator comparison tool as always :

# The good news
The rules for next delegation cycle for mina foundation and o1labs have changed.
The number of elligible BPs to foundation was reduced from 240 to 80.
The number of elligible BPs to o1labs delegation program was reduced from 120 to 64.

:::note  ❤️  
My BP was choosen amongst hundred of others to be part of the new delegation program for both mina foundation and o1labs.

:::important  What does it mean for you ?  
It means that the stake delegated to my BP will be 3 times the previous delegated stake !!!
It also means that we can expect much more slots assigned and much more blocks produced and thus, more rewards for you my fellow delegators !!

Next epoch (11) total stake will be up from ~900k minas delegated to 2,6M Minas delegated ! with a block production rate expected to be 3 times what it was before !!
