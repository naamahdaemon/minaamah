# New tool for Mina Block Producer
I developed a new handy tool for mina block producers.  

This little handy script gets the next block production slot timestamp from your local GraphQL server and adds it to the google calendar of your choice.

The tool is available on my GitHub here : https://github.com/naamahdaemon/block2gca/
