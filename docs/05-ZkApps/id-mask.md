## App description
From the original web site :

:::info  Description
idMask is an app that enables the creation of zero-knowledge proofs, empowering individuals to verify statements about their identity to third parties without disclosing any personal information.  
  
Produced proofs can be utilized by other parties that find it useful, for example other apps, governments, DEX'es and what not.
:::

ID-Mask allows anyone to generate several kind of proofs, provided by trustful sources (supported trust source on mainnet is the 
Smart-ID identity application ([see below](#smartid)).  

* Proof of Age
* Proof of non-sanctions
* Proof of unique Human
* Proof of Nationality

It is possible to simulate id verification on testnet in order to have an overview of the way it is working.  

:::note
As I cannot use smart-id in my country, I was not able to real test proof generation on mainnet.  
Instead I only performed tests on testnet using automatically generated dummy data.  
:::

Once the proof is generated, then it can be either kept local (front-end generated proof) or be propagated onchain or in Google or Apple Wallet so it can be presented to proove your statements whenever it is required to a 3d party verifier. 

* * *
## Settings
![Settings](./img/idmask13.png)

Settings allows you to change the behaviour of the application :

* Switch network (MAINNET / DEVNET)
* Change service URL (GraphQL endpoints, Explorer endpoints , ..)
* Activate Console debug logs
* Make user wallet signature mandatory for proof generation
* Use Cache to improve proof generation/verification speed 
* ...

* * * 
## Let's give it a try !
### Pre-requisites
In order to test ID-Mask, you will need :  

* A Mina wallet (Auro / Clorio / Pallad)
* A Mina testnet address that you created from your favorite wallet
* Some Minas on your account ([see below](#faucet))

And this is all you will need !

:::warning  Using ID-Mask from your mobile phone
Theoritically, you can use ID-Mask from your wallet embedded web browser to connect your address to ID-Mask and sign the smart contracts.  
It appears as for now, this is not really usable from a mobile phone as proof generation occurs on the front-end side and requires some CPU power and is way too long on a mobile phone.  
For this reason, I will advise that you try from your desktop web browser using the web extension of your favorite wallet.  
:::

### Proof Generation
As stated above, ID-Mask can generate 4 categories of proofs :

* Proof of Age
* Proof of non-sanctions
* Proof of unique Human
* Proof of Nationality

![Proofs generation](./img/idmask3.png)

Let's try with the first one : **Proof of Age**

#### STEP 1 - Get Mocked Data
![Get Data](./img/idmask4.png)

#### STEP 2 - Create the Proof
![Create Age Proof](./img/idmask5.png)

If you required from the settings that your wallet signed the generated proof then your web extension wallet should open and let you sign the request.  

![Wallet triggers](./img/idmask6.png)
![Proof Signature](./img/idmask7.png)

#### STEP 3 - Save the generated proof
Once the proof is generated, you can save it for later user by verifier :

* In a JSON file
* By putting it onchain
* By adding it to your Google or Apple wallet

![Add Proof to Wallet](./img/idmask12.png)

Let's put our proof onchain by clicking on **Put on chain**.

![Put Proof onchain](./img/idmask8.png)

:::note
It may take quite some time so be patient ðŸ˜‰
:::

Accept the transaction in your wallet

![sign transaction](./img/idmask9.png)

Once everything is ok, you'll notice a popup informing you that the transaction is now onchain.  
You can click on the link that will redirect you to the transaction details in a mina explorer.  

![check transaction](./img/idmask10.png)

In my example : https://minascan.io/devnet/tx/5JvCdR2A9EQixYNCAEUUo4HbWzkgz7x2b4Zc762r5MCU1zw9Kj73?type=zk-tx

* * *
### Proof Verification
You can then have your generated proof verified either by :
* Uploading the JSON file generated above
* Checking your Mina address if you put your proof onchain
* Scanning the Google/Apple Wallet Proof QRCode

### DEVNET/TESTNET Faucet
:::note  Request a DEVNET/FAUCET <a name='faucet'></a>
Once you have created your wallet address on TESTNET through Auro/Clorio/Pallad, you can request some tMINA to test.  
For this fill in your wallet address on this page : https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/
