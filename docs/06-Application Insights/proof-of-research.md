# Proof of Research (PoR) on Mina Protocol

---
## Preamble: Why Useful Proof of Work Was Impossible Before ZK
For years, researchers and developers have explored the idea of turning Proof of Work into something useful â€” so that instead of burning energy on meaningless hashing, networks could contribute to science, AI, or data analysis.  

However, this idea always faced a fundamental obstacle: **how to verify useful work efficiently**.  

Any useful computation, such as training an AI model, sequencing DNA, or analyzing large datasets, is inherently expensive to compute and equally expensive to verify. Without a way to separate the cost of computation from the cost of verification, blockchains could not safely use such tasks for consensus.  


This is why early *Proof of Useful Work* projects (Primecoin, CureCoin, FoldingCoin) struggled to gain adoption: they lacked a verification method that was both fast and cryptographically sound.  

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** changed this equation. With zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and especially recursive proofs as implemented in **Mina Protocol**, it became possible to prove the correctness of a computation once, and let anyone verify it in milliseconds.  

This decouples the heavy cost of performing useful research from the trivial cost of verification.  
In other words, ZKPs are the missing link that transforms Proof of Useful Work from an impractical dream into a feasible consensus mechanism.

## Abstract
We introduce **Proof of Research (PoR)**, a novel consensus mechanism that transforms blockchain security into a vehicle for useful computation.  

Unlike Proof of Work (PoW), where energy is expended on meaningless hashing, PoR leverages **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** and Mina Protocolâ€™s **recursive cryptography** to validate real-world scientific and computational tasks as part of block production.  

This creates the first blockchain where the act of securing the network simultaneously contributes to scientific progress, AI training, bioinformatics, and large-scale data analysis.  


---

## Related Work
Over the past decade, multiple projects have attempted to connect blockchain security with useful computation. While these efforts demonstrated creativity, none have succeeded in building a fully decentralized, verifiable, and secure consensus mechanism based on useful work.  


- **Primecoin (2013)**: used mining to discover prime number chains. Valuable but extremely narrow in scope.  
- **CureCoin / FoldingCoin**: rewarded contributions to Folding@home but relied on external verification.  
- **Gridcoin**: connected to BOINC computing, again dependent on trusted external servers.  
- **Golem, iExec, Akash**: decentralized compute marketplaces, but separate from consensus.  
- **Bittensor (2021)**: incentivized AI training, but verification remained benchmark-based, not cryptographic.  


**Why PoR is different:**  

- ZKPs enable cryptographic proofs of useful computation, verified in milliseconds.  
- Recursive aggregation (Mina) condenses thousands of proofs into one succinct proof.  
- A **hybrid PoS + PoR** design ties consensus to both financial stake and useful research contributions â€” a combination never previously achieved.

## Roles
- **Task Submitters (Researchers / Enterprises / Individuals)**: Publish useful computational tasks and pay in tokens for execution.  
- **Compute Nodes (Workers)**: Execute assigned tasks using CPUs/GPUs and generate raw results.  
- **Proof Generators (Provers)**: Produce zk-proofs certifying correctness of computations.  
- **Aggregators**: Combine many zk-proofs into a single recursive proof.  
- **Validators (PoS Layer)**: Secure consensus and include aggregated proofs in blocks.  
- **Mina L1**: Anchors the final proof, ensuring trust, immutability, and global verifiability.

## zkApps as Research Circuits
One of Minaâ€™s unique strengths is the ability to express computations as **zkApps** â€” zero-knowledge smart contracts.  
In the context of PoR, **task submitters could provide zkApps representing their research problems**. 


Each zkApp would define:  

- **Inputs**: research data (datasets, parameters, genetic sequences, model weights, etc.).  
- **Logic (circuit)**: the algorithmic computation to be performed (e.g., matrix multiplication, alignment algorithm, AI training step).  
- **Outputs**: the computed result **plus a zk-proof** certifying that the computation was executed correctly.  

This model allows every research task to be formalized as a verifiable circuit. Compute nodes simply execute zkApps with provided inputs, generating results and proofs. Aggregators then combine these proofs recursively into a single succinct certificate of research, which validators embed into the blockchain.  

In practice, this transforms the blockchain into a **library of reusable, verifiable research circuits**.  
Any researcher can design and deploy zkApps for their field, enabling a global decentralized marketplace of provable scientific computation.

## Why a Hybrid PoS + PoR Consensus
A pure PoR system faces challenges:  

- No economic penalty for malicious actors (unlike slashing in PoS).  
- Vulnerability to sybil attacks with trivial proofs.  
- Lack of fork-choice and finality guarantees.  
- Risk of centralization by large compute farms.  


The hybrid model combines the best of both worlds:  

- **PoS** ensures economic security, sybil resistance, and finality.  
- **PoR** injects scientific and societal value into block production.  


In practice:  

- Validators must stake tokens.  
- To propose a block, they must also embed an aggregated proof of research.  
- Rewards are shared between validators (security) and compute contributors (useful work).

---

## Conclusion
