## Wallets
Although there is no -official- mina wallet (you still can use the command line if your a true warrior üòÅ), there are a few community provided wallets.
Those wallets have undergone an independent security audit (but do not believe me, do your own research !). Nevertheless, they are widely used by the community. There may be other wallets out there but as I don't know them, I won't list them here (again, do your own research)

- [ ] AURO wallet : https://www.aurowallet.com/  
_Maybe one of the most popular wallet. Auro is available as and Android or iOS application as well as a browser extension. It supports ledger hardware wallet too._

- [ ] Clorio wallet : https://clor.io/  
_Another popular wallet available as a desktop application or a browser extension. Clorio is not available on mobile (from my knowledge)._
