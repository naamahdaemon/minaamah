Epoch 9 recently ended. 3 blocks were produced on 6 slots assigned. Not the best epoch so far. Epoch 10 should be better with 11 slots assigned and already 4 blocks produced. You may have noticed something special happened during epoch 9. My BP produced a block including a delegation transaction with a huge erroneous amount of fees (27477 minas !!). You can see this transaction in this block : https://minascan.io/mainnet/block/3NKQkodGBduoupbcpi4yLGwrxshe7FymWkr1giqCBLu83ESdq6KX/txs Of course, it was an error from the delegator who thought he should specify the amount to be delegated in the fees. I returned the funds to the sender (Being honest as a BP is not an option). It means that fees will not be shared amongst delegators for epoch 9 (as I would have to pay more than 27000 mina from my own wallet !). It does not make a big difference though as fees are most of the time very low. Compare it with other BPs using my validator comparison tool as always : https://mina.naamahdaemon.eu/payout-simulator The good news The rules for next delegation cycle for mina foundation and o1labs have changed. The number of elligible BPs to foundation was reduced from 240 to 80. The number of elligible BPs to o1labs delegation program was reduced from 120 to 64. ❤️ My BP was choosen amongst hundred of others to be part of the new delegation program for both mina foundation and o1labs. What does it mean for you ? It means that the stake delegated to my BP will be 3 times the previous delegated stake !!! It also means that we can expect much more slots assigned and much more blocks produced and thus, more rewards for you my fellow delegators !!

This update will bring the ZK programmability layer to the blockchain and ending the supercharged rewards. In the same time several potential impacts should be expected. D-Day Timeline The progress of the upgrade and the timeline are documented here: https://minaprotocol.com/blog/minas-berkeley-upgrade-what-to-expect and here https://minaprotocol.com/mainnet-upgrade-status The Block producer timeline Every block producer will have to update their nodes in order to ensure the resume of the upgraded Blockchain. Here is a simplified overview of the tasks that every block producer will have to achieve on June, 4th. Before June, 4th The only action required by block producer is to update their nodes to version 2.0.0. (All my nodes are upgraded already obviously !) On June, 4th STEP 1 No specific action is required until the stop network slot is reached (14:00 UTC). At least one node must still be active and connected to the network until the stop slot is reached (ideally, all nodes of an operator can remain online). The calculation of uptime will be taken into account until the stop slot is reached (14:00 UTC). STEP 2 Until the upgrade package is released (20:00 UTC): No action required. STEP 3 Once the upgrade package is available: All operators update and restart their nodes (20:00 UTC - 00:00 UTC). Uptime calculation will resume at 00:01 UTC with a tolerance until 01:01 UTC. remarque During this period, no block will be produced. STEP 4 From 00:00 UTC, the blockchain will restart on Berkeley fully operational: block production, snarks production, uptime, ... What's next ? After the Hard Fork (if all goes well): The end of supercharged blocks will result in a decrease in profitability but will also level the playing field for all serious validators. It will also reduce the number of new tokens created, which will limit the inflationary nature of the token (and that's a good thing). As a delegator, it will be important to ensure that your validator is up-to-date with their nodes from now on (version 2.0.0) until the update is triggered and their validation nodes are updated, otherwise, they will operate a zombie chain that will no longer produce valid rewards (for you). I encourage everyone to contact their validator to ensure they are up-to-date and that everything is in order for the update on 06/04. Finally, there will certainly be impacts on tools, explorers, and websites concerning Mina. Some blockchain explorers may experience disruptions or become non-functional or display inconsistent information. Other services will be completely stopped (e.g., Mina Explorer's GraphQL APIs), which may also cause interruptions to some services that use them (my site, for example, uses the Mina Explorer GraphQL API, which I will have to replace eventually to display produced blocks, delegations, and payouts). In summary, be patient, do not hesitate to contact your validator if you have any questions or problems, and do not panic if the rewards for the epoch post-hard fork take a little time to arrive 😉 This update is going to be epic. It is important to realize the amount of work and investment that goes into not only updating but also synchronizing all the actors, which are ultimately the key to the success of updating a fully decentralized application.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Mina Payout Calculator added","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/blog/Mina Payout Calculator added","content":"You can now retieve the current (or selected) epooch due payouts to my delegators in real time here : Payouts You'll find also additional realtime information on my Block Producer here : Block ProductionDelegations","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Support me by delegating to my Block Producer !","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/blog","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Wallet Watch list​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Support me by delegating to my Block Producer !","url":"/fr/blog#wallet-watch-list","content":" You can add, name, remove, rename any mina wallet address you want to watch for any transaction occuring on that address including :  Payment transaction in/outStake delegation transaction in/outzkApps transactionsToken transfers    ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"/watch <address> [<name>]​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Support me by delegating to my Block Producer !","url":"/fr/blog#watch-address-name","content":" Enable watch on &lt;address&gt;  Example /watch B62qrmRJosdwWKwFXjfLEA7fNaPDkAiSkGmGDLiPQkphCcnC7agyYEZ MY_WALLET 🆕 User `xxxxxxxxxx` added address `B62qrmRJosdwWKwFXjfLEA7fNaPDkAiSkGmGDLiPQkphCcnC7agyYEZ` to their watchlist 👁️ Address added : `B62qrmRJosdwWKwFXjfLEA7fNaPDkAiSkGmGDLiPQkphCcnC7agyYEZ (MY_WALLET)`   You will then receive alert notification messages whenever a transfer occur on this address.

This impacted the payout timeline for several reasons. The first one is that we were asked by the Mina foundation to delay the payouts for epoch 78 until the Hardfork happened. Epoch 78 ended around 4AM on June, 4th a few hours before the upgrade process begun. Right after the Epoch 78 ended, the epoch 79 started on the old chain. This epoch 79 lasted only a few slots/blocks until we reached the transaction stop slot at June 4th, 9AM UTC that started the upgrade process. We are now on the new chain. This new chain started again from Epoch 0 !! This is a bit like a reborn of the Mina Blockchain !! Time for everyone to ugrade and ensure everything is ok was the main reason to delay the payouts. I was also asked personnaly by the Mina Foundation to delay my payouts a bit in order to perform some validation tests. At this time (June 07th), I am still waiting the Go from the mina fundation to trigger my payouts for both epoch 78 and 79. Once I get the go, I will immediately trigger the payout for both epochs.

This update will bring the ZK programmability layer to the blockchain and ending the supercharged rewards. In the same time several potential impacts should be expected. D-Day Timeline The progress of the upgrade and the timeline are documented here: https://minaprotocol.com/blog/minas-berkeley-upgrade-what-to-expect and here https://minaprotocol.com/mainnet-upgrade-status The Block producer timeline Every block producer will have to update their nodes in order to ensure the resume of the upgraded Blockchain. Here is a simplified overview of the tasks that every block producer will have to achieve on June, 4th. Before June, 4th The only action required by block producer is to update their nodes to version 2.0.0. (All my nodes are upgraded already obviously !) On June, 4th STEP 1 No specific action is required until the stop network slot is reached (14:00 UTC). At least one node must still be active and connected to the network until the stop slot is reached (ideally, all nodes of an operator can remain online). The calculation of uptime will be taken into account until the stop slot is reached (14:00 UTC). STEP 2 Until the upgrade package is released (20:00 UTC): No action required. STEP 3 Once the upgrade package is available: All operators update and restart their nodes (20:00 UTC - 00:00 UTC). Uptime calculation will resume at 00:01 UTC with a tolerance until 01:01 UTC. remarque During this period, no block will be produced. STEP 4 From 00:00 UTC, the blockchain will restart on Berkeley fully operational: block production, snarks production, uptime, ... What's next ? After the Hard Fork (if all goes well): The end of supercharged blocks will result in a decrease in profitability but will also level the playing field for all serious validators. It will also reduce the number of new tokens created, which will limit the inflationary nature of the token (and that's a good thing). As a delegator, it will be important to ensure that your validator is up-to-date with their nodes from now on (version 2.0.0) until the update is triggered and their validation nodes are updated, otherwise, they will operate a zombie chain that will no longer produce valid rewards (for you). I encourage everyone to contact their validator to ensure they are up-to-date and that everything is in order for the update on 06/04. Finally, there will certainly be impacts on tools, explorers, and websites concerning Mina. Some blockchain explorers may experience disruptions or become non-functional or display inconsistent information. Other services will be completely stopped (e.g., Mina Explorer's GraphQL APIs), which may also cause interruptions to some services that use them (my site, for example, uses the Mina Explorer GraphQL API, which I will have to replace eventually to display produced blocks, delegations, and payouts). In summary, be patient, do not hesitate to contact your validator if you have any questions or problems, and do not panic if the rewards for the epoch post-hard fork take a little time to arrive 😉 This update is going to be epic. It is important to realize the amount of work and investment that goes into not only updating but also synchronizing all the actors, which are ultimately the key to the success of updating a fully decentralized application.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Qu'est-ce que Mina Protocol ?","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/blog/tags/hello","content":"En tant que participant actif de la communauté Mina Protocol, je suis très fier d'exploiter un nœud de validation.

Mina Protocol est une plateforme blockchain révolutionnaire conçue pour offrir évolutivité et sécurité grâce à sa technologie de blockchain succincte unique. Contrairement aux blockchains traditionnelles, qui augmentent en taille à mesure que davantage de transactions sont ajoutées, Mina maintient une taille constante de seulement quelques kilooctets, grâce à l'utilisation innovante des zk-SNARKs (arguments de connaissance succincts non interactifs de connaissance zéro). Cela garantit que Mina reste légère et accessible, permettant à quiconque d'exploiter un nœud complet sans nécessiter de ressources informatiques étendues. Programmabilité ZK et SDK o1js L'une des caractéristiques distinctives de Mina Protocol est sa programmabilité à connaissance zéro (ZK). Cela permet aux développeurs de créer et de déployer des contrats intelligents qui préservent la confidentialité et la sécurité tout en restant efficaces et évolutifs. Le SDK o1js (Kit de Développement Logiciel) est un outil puissant qui permet aux développeurs de créer facilement des applications alimentées par ZK sur Mina. Avec ce SDK, la création d'applications décentralisées sécurisées, privées et performantes devient simple, permettant aux développeurs d'innover sans les limitations typiques des plateformes blockchain traditionnelles.

Mon implication va bien au-delà de la simple maintenance du nœud ; je suis un membre actif de la communauté Discord, toujours prêt à offrir mon aide à ceux qui en ont besoin. En partageant mes connaissances et en fournissant un soutien, je m'efforce de contribuer à la croissance et au succès de l'écosystème Mina Protocol. Qu'est-ce que Mina Protocol ? Mina Protocol est une plateforme blockchain révolutionnaire conçue pour offrir évolutivité et sécurité grâce à sa technologie de blockchain succincte unique. Contrairement aux blockchains traditionnelles, qui augmentent en taille à mesure que davantage de transactions sont ajoutées, Mina maintient une taille constante de seulement quelques kilooctets, grâce à l'utilisation innovante des zk-SNARKs (arguments de connaissance succincts non interactifs de connaissance zéro). Cela garantit que Mina reste légère et accessible, permettant à quiconque d'exploiter un nœud complet sans nécessiter de ressources informatiques étendues. Programmabilité ZK et SDK o1js L'une des caractéristiques distinctives de Mina Protocol est sa programmabilité à connaissance zéro (ZK). Cela permet aux développeurs de créer et de déployer des contrats intelligents qui préservent la confidentialité et la sécurité tout en restant efficaces et évolutifs. Le SDK o1js (Kit de Développement Logiciel) est un outil puissant qui permet aux développeurs de créer facilement des applications alimentées par ZK sur Mina. Avec ce SDK, la création d'applications décentralisées sécurisées, privées et performantes devient simple, permettant aux développeurs d'innover sans les limitations typiques des plateformes blockchain traditionnelles. À propos de ce site Ce site est une ressource complète pour tout ce qui concerne Mina Protocol. Vous y trouverez : Informations générales : Un aperçu de Mina Protocol, de ses fonctionnalités uniques et des avantages qu'il offre. Détails techniques : Des guides approfondis et une documentation pour les personnes intéressées par l'exécution de leur propre nœud de validation Mina, couvrant tout, de la configuration à la maintenance.

This update will bring the ZK programmability layer to the blockchain and ending the supercharged rewards. In the same time several potential impacts should be expected. D-Day Timeline The progress of the upgrade and the timeline are documented here: https://minaprotocol.com/blog/minas-berkeley-upgrade-what-to-expect and here https://minaprotocol.com/mainnet-upgrade-status The Block producer timeline Every block producer will have to update their nodes in order to ensure the resume of the upgraded Blockchain. Here is a simplified overview of the tasks that every block producer will have to achieve on June, 4th. Before June, 4th The only action required by block producer is to update their nodes to version 2.0.0. (All my nodes are upgraded already obviously !) On June, 4th STEP 1 No specific action is required until the stop network slot is reached (14:00 UTC). At least one node must still be active and connected to the network until the stop slot is reached (ideally, all nodes of an operator can remain online). The calculation of uptime will be taken into account until the stop slot is reached (14:00 UTC). STEP 2 Until the upgrade package is released (20:00 UTC): No action required. STEP 3 Once the upgrade package is available: All operators update and restart their nodes (20:00 UTC - 00:00 UTC). Uptime calculation will resume at 00:01 UTC with a tolerance until 01:01 UTC. remarque During this period, no block will be produced. STEP 4 From 00:00 UTC, the blockchain will restart on Berkeley fully operational: block production, snarks production, uptime, ... What's next ? After the Hard Fork (if all goes well): The end of supercharged blocks will result in a decrease in profitability but will also level the playing field for all serious validators. It will also reduce the number of new tokens created, which will limit the inflationary nature of the token (and that's a good thing). As a delegator, it will be important to ensure that your validator is up-to-date with their nodes from now on (version 2.0.0) until the update is triggered and their validation nodes are updated, otherwise, they will operate a zombie chain that will no longer produce valid rewards (for you). I encourage everyone to contact their validator to ensure they are up-to-date and that everything is in order for the update on 06/04. Finally, there will certainly be impacts on tools, explorers, and websites concerning Mina. Some blockchain explorers may experience disruptions or become non-functional or display inconsistent information. Other services will be completely stopped (e.g., Mina Explorer's GraphQL APIs), which may also cause interruptions to some services that use them (my site, for example, uses the Mina Explorer GraphQL API, which I will have to replace eventually to display produced blocks, delegations, and payouts). In summary, be patient, do not hesitate to contact your validator if you have any questions or problems, and do not panic if the rewards for the epoch post-hard fork take a little time to arrive 😉 This update is going to be epic. It is important to realize the amount of work and investment that goes into not only updating but also synchronizing all the actors, which are ultimately the key to the success of updating a fully decentralized application.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Welcome to Our Application Insights Section!","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fr/docs/Application Insights","content":"Welcome to Our Application Insights Section!

However, this idea always faced a fundamental obstacle: how to verify useful work efficiently.  Any useful computation, such as training an AI model, sequencing DNA, or analyzing large datasets, is inherently expensive to compute and equally expensive to verify. Without a way to separate the cost of computation from the cost of verification, blockchains could not safely use such tasks for consensus.  This is why early Proof of Useful Work projects (Primecoin, CureCoin, FoldingCoin) struggled to gain adoption: they lacked a verification method that was both fast and cryptographically sound.  Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) changed this equation. With zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and especially recursive proofs as implemented in Mina Protocol, it became possible to prove the correctness of a computation once, and let anyone verify it in milliseconds.  This decouples the heavy cost of performing useful research from the trivial cost of verification. In other words, ZKPs are the missing link that transforms Proof of Useful Work from an impractical dream into a feasible consensus mechanism.

This model allows every research task to be formalized as a verifiable circuit. Compute nodes simply execute zkApps with provided inputs, generating results and proofs. Aggregators then combine these proofs recursively into a single succinct certificate of research, which validators embed into the blockchain.

Processeur : Seule l'architecture CPU AMD64 est prise en charge. Matériel : L'envoi et la réception de MINA ne nécessitent aucun matériel spécial. Pour exécuter un producteur de blocs sur le réseau Mina, vous aurez besoin d'au moins : Processeur 8 cœurs16 Go de RAM Exécution d'un ou plusieurs Snarks Worker Une quantité supplémentaire de RAM est nécessaire pour exécuter un ou plusieurs SNARK workers en même temps qu'un producteur de blocs. Réseau : Au moins une connexion de 1 Mbps. Instances VM officiellement testées : O(1) Labs a testé l'exécution de nœuds sur plusieurs fournisseurs de cloud et recommande les instances suivantes pour les besoins de base des opérateurs de nœuds. Des exigences personnalisées et des contraintes de coût différentes peuvent nécessiter un type d'instance différent. AWS c5.2xlargeGCP c2-standard-8Azure Standard_F8s_v2Digital Ocean c-8-16gib  Remarque complémentaire sur les pré-requis Concernant les recommandations officielles, j'ajouterais un certain nombre de remarques ci-dessous.  Concernant le matériel supporté A noter que seul les processeurs Intel/AMD 64 sont supportés. Inutile d'essayer de faire tourner Mina sur un Raspberry Pi !! Concernant les systèmes d'exploitation supportés A la liste officielle, il est bon de rajouter qu'une distribution linux (ex: Ubuntu 20.04) installée via WSL2 (Windows Linux Sub-System) permet de faire tourner un noeud de validation ainsi que l'ensemble des fonctionnalités associées (Snark Worker, ..) sans aucun souci aussi facilement que sur une machine Linux nativement. Il est bien entendu aussi possible d'utiliser Docker™ sur Windows pour installer Mina. Concernant la puissance de la machine / quantité de mémoire requises S'il est possible de faire tourner Mina, d'après les recommandations officielles sur une machine équipée d'un processeur 8 coeurs et de 16Go de RAM. Par expérience, je recommande très fortement une machine équipée d'un CPU 16 coeurs et de 32Go de RAM.  remarque Je ne suis jamais parvenu à produire et broadcaster un bloc dans les temps avec une machine équipée d'un processeur 8 coeurs et de 16Go de RAM !!  remarque Mina n'exploite pas (encore) la puissance des cartes graphiques pour la validation. Inutile donc d'être un Gamer pour faire tourner un noeud de validation. Seule la puissance du CPU est utilisée.  génération de processeurs D'autre part la génération du CPU revêt aussi une importance significative. Un processeur datant de plusieurs années, à nombre de coeurs/threads égaux sera beaucoup moins puissant qu'un processeur récent. Je recommande un Ryzen 7 7700 qui vous assurera une puissance plus que suffisante pour la production de blocs et de Snarks  Concernant les fournisseurs cloud / VPS / VM et serveurs dédiés En plus de la liste officielle fournie par Mina qui comprend les acteurs majeurs du Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean), il est possible de trouver d'autres fournisseurs proposant des serveurs dédiés et/ou VM permettant de faire tourner un noeud de validation. A noter toutefois que la politique d'utilisation de ces fournisseurs peut interdire l'utilisation des machines pour tout usage concernant la blockchain et en particulier la mise en oeuvre d'un noeud de validation qu'il soit en PoW ou en PoS.  Il est bon de préciser aussi que le coût de fonctionnement d'une machine louée ou d'une VM dédiée dans un environnement cloud peut être extrêmement prohibitif et au final ne pas s'avérer rentable. Ce coût peut aller de plusieurs dizaine d'Euros par mois (50-90) pour un serveur dédié à plusieurs centaines d'Euros par mois (300-800) pour les services cloud les plus chers (GCP, Azure, AWS, ..)  danger Il est donc très important de mesurer la rentabilité du projet avant de s'engager dans des frais récurrents qui peuvent s'avérer très élevés. D'autant qu'il est souvent souhaitable/indispensable d'assurer une redondance au niveau des machines (entre 2 et 3 serveurs) -ce qui multiplie les coûts- afin d'assurer le fonctionnement de la blockchain en continue.  Alternative La meilleure alternative en terme de coût, service, philosophie de la blockchain et décentralisation reste bien entendu le fonctionnement d'un noeud de validation local, non déporté chez un fournisseur tiers. Pour cela, n'importe quel ordinateur suffisament puissant peut faire l'affaire à la condition que cette machine puisse rester connectée au réseau 24/7. Il existe des mini-PC suffisament puissant (Ryzen 7, Core i7/i9) très abordable permettant de faire tourner un noeud de validation local de chez soi.

Uptime value The uptime retrieved from the script is the splipping 24 hours uptime.

Please note that when a block is produced, an additional entry in the logs is added that will count as a snark upload as well.

L'achat de mina nécessite de se connecter à une plateforme d'échange qui permet d'échanger une devise (Euro, USD, autre crypto, ..) contre des minas.  Une fois les minas en votre possession, ils sont disponibles via la plateforme d'échange et vous pouvez éventuellement procéder à des trades (short, long) sur vos token sur les paires d'échanges disponibles sur la plateforme.  info Il n'existe quasiment aucune plateforme d'échange aujourd'hui qui vous permette d'accéder à votre clé privée qui est du point de vue de la blockchain la seule preuve que vos token vous appartiennent. Au lieu de cela, les adresses de vos wallet sur les échanges vous sont attribués par la plateforme qui ne vous donne accès la plupart du temps qu'à la clé publique du wallet (qui vous permet de déposer des fonds) sans jamais vous donner accès à la clé privée (qui vous permet d'opérer, de sortir des fonds, de contrôler, ....) votre wallet.  CONCLUSION Vos tokens stockés sur un échange ne vous appartiennent pas !!!  Les avantages de conserver ses token sur une plateforme d'échange L'avantage de stocker sur une plateforme d'échange (et il n'y en a qu'un !) est de pouvoir trader (=échanger / acheter / vendre) rapidement vos token.  Les inconvénients de conserver ses tokens sur une plateforme d'échange Il y a de nombreux désavantages à laisser ses tokens sur une plateforme centralisée :  Le premier est que c'est en totale contradiction avec le principe même de la blockchain qui est d'être décentralisée.Le second inconvénient est que vous n'avez aucun contrôle en théorie sur vos fonds. Si la plateforme met la clé sous la porte, vous perdez alors 100% de vos investissements !!Le troisième inconvénient concerne le staking. Le staking dans le contexte d'une blockchain basée sur le Proof Of Stake (PoS) comme Mina consiste à déléguer1 ses token à un validateur2 de confiance afin de lui octroyer des chances supplémentaires de produire des blocs3 générant des récompenses (coinbase4). Ces récompenses sont ensuite distribuées aux délégateurs au prorata du nombre de mina délégués moins la commission prise par le validateur (En théorie entre 0% et 10%, la majorité appliquant un taux de 5%). Lorsque vos minas sont stockées sur une plateforme, dans le meilleur des cas, celle-ci propose leurs propres conditions de staking a des taux de commission élevés mais la plupart des plateformes ne propose tout simplement pas de staking, vous privant alors d'une source de revenu passive loin d'être négligeable (entre 12% et 24% d'APR)Le quatrième inconvénient est qu'un wallet non custodial ne permet pas l'utilisation de ce wallet sur des applications spécifiques de la blockchain (DApps ou zkApps5 dans le contexte Mina).  1 Staking Plus d'info sur le staking dans la section dédiée. Cliquez ici : 🔗Staking Guide  2 Validateur Généralement, dans une blockchain basée sur du Proof of Stake, un validateur est un participant à la blockchain qui bloque un certain montant de token en garantie. Cette garantie sert de dépôt de sécurité et garantit que les validateurs ont un intérêt financier à maintenir l'intégrité du réseau. Dans le contexte de Mina, il est important de noter que les fonds mis en jeu pour le staking ne sont pas vérouillés Cela signifie que les fonds des délégateurs utilisés pour le staking peuvent être déplacés, re-délégués, un-délégués, transférés, échangés, vendus librement à tout moment.  3 Blocs Les validateurs se relaient pour créer de nouveaux blocs et valider des transactions en fonction de la quantité de cryptomonnaie qu'ils ont mise en jeu (en propre ou via des délégations). Plus un validateur a de cryptomonnaie en jeu (ou de token délégués) , plus il a de chances d'être choisi pour créer un nouveau bloc.  4 Coinbase Les validateurs sont récompensés par des cryptomonnaies supplémentaires pour avoir créé et validé avec succès des blocs. Le coinbase est une transaction spéciale dans un bloc nouvellement créé qui contient la récompense due au validateur ayant produit le nouveau bloc.

Les paiements des récompenses de bloc se font hors chaîne, que le fournisseur de services de staking devrait vous envoyer. Vérifiez avec chaque fournisseur/pool pour ses conditions de délégation (frais, versement des récompenses, ..) Assurez-vous de faire vos propres recherches avant de choisir un pool de staking. Parmi les critères importants à considérer : Performance du nœud (cliquez sur chaque validateur dans cette liste pour voir leurs statistiques de performance.)Leur réactivité, leur activité et leur réputation au sein de la communautéLeurs conditions (% de frais qu'ils facturent, fréquence d'envoi des récompenses, etc.) et leur historique de respect de ces conditions (peut être vérifié en utilisant un explorateur de blocs (comme Mina Explorer, Minataur, Minascan) Si vous avez des questions sur les pools de mise en jeu, il y a un canal #staking-pool sur le serveur Discord de Mina.  info J'ai également développé un calculateur de récompenses pour les délégateurs / un simulateur de paiement / un outil de comparaison de la performance des producteurs de blocs disponible ici : https://mina.naamahdaemon.eu/payout-simulator Cela peut vous aider à déterminer quel validateur peut vous offrir les meilleurs rendements.
