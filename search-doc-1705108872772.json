This enables independent validators to produce blocks and receive rewards (coinbase) for the production of these blocks. Information about how to join and program conditions are available here : https://www.minafoundation.com/#delegation In practice, the conditions to be met to qualify for a delegation from the foundation are as follows: Operate one or more servers running a Mina validation node.Maintain a global server uptime of 100% for a minimum of 3 months (90 days), after which the first eligibility condition will be met (uptime = 100%).Provide the KYC (Know Your Customer) information requested by the program initiators (Mina Foundation / o1Labs) through one of their approved partners (Coinlist / Synaps).Be among the top 240 validators with the highest uptime score (100% being the standard; there are approximately 340 operators with 100% uptime today). In case of a tie, the foundation or o1labs conducts a random draw. Once the delegation is obtained, adhere to the rules imposed by the foundation: Calculate the reward amount to be returned to each delegator accurately (there is a script to automate this process).Return the required reward amount within the specified timeframe (block 3500 of epoch n+1 at the latest)Follow the rules (transaction memo containing the MD5 hash of the block producer's public address, amount, and repayment deadline)","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Why Mina ?","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/intro","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Mina Protocol Overview‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Mina ?","url":"/docs/intro#mina-protocol-overview","content":" Mina Protocol aims to be a lightweight blockchain, maintaining a constant size of only 22 KB, regardless of transaction volume. This allows easy node operation and network participation without requiring sophisticated hardware. The native cryptocurrency, MINA, facilitates network transactions and fee distribution.  Blockchain Size Challenges  Traditional blockchains face size challenges with Ethereum growing from 5 GB (April 2016) to over 220 GB (April 2021). Mina addresses this with zk-SNARKS cryptography, reducing the need for each node to store entire transaction histories, promoting decentralization.
