This enables independent validators to produce blocks and receive rewards (coinbase) for the production of these blocks. Information about how to join and program conditions are available here : https://www.minafoundation.com/#delegation In practice, the conditions to be met to qualify for a delegation from the foundation are as follows: Operate one or more servers running a Mina validation node.Maintain a global server uptime of 100% for a minimum of 3 months (90 days), after which the first eligibility condition will be met (uptime = 100%).Provide the KYC (Know Your Customer) information requested by the program initiators (Mina Foundation / o1Labs) through one of their approved partners (Coinlist / Synaps).Be among the top 240 validators with the highest uptime score (100% being the standard; there are approximately 340 operators with 100% uptime today). In case of a tie, the foundation or o1labs conducts a random draw. Once the delegation is obtained, adhere to the rules imposed by the foundation: Calculate the reward amount to be returned to each delegator accurately (there is a script to automate this process).Return the required reward amount within the specified timeframe (block 3500 of epoch n+1 at the latest)Follow the rules (transaction memo containing the MD5 hash of the block producer's public address, amount, and repayment deadline)","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Useful links","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/General Information/usefull_links","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Mina Roadmap‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Useful links","url":"/docs/General Information/usefull_links#mina-roadmap","content":" You will find the exciting Mina roadmap on official web site here :    ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Mina Official links‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Useful links","url":"/docs/General Information/usefull_links#mina-official-links","content":"  Mina official website : https://minaprotocol.com Mina discord server : Mina discord server Mina official documentation : https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en You'll find here how to run a node and many other information.

Processor: Only AMD64 CPU architecture is supported. Hardware: Sending and receiving MINA does not require any special hardware. Running a block producer on the Mina network requires at least: 8-core processor16 GB of RAM Executing one or more Snarks worker More RAM is required to run a SNARK worker node at the same time as a block producer. Network: At least 1 Mbps connection Officially Tested VM Instances : O(1) Labs has tested running nodes on several cloud providers. We recommend the following instances for basic node operator needs. Custom requirements and different cost constraints might require a different instance type. AWS c5.2xlargeGCP c2-standard-8Azure Standard_F8s_v2Digital Ocean c-8-16gib  Additional Note on Prerequisites Regarding the official recommendations, I would add some remarks below.  Regarding supported hardware Note that only Intel/AMD 64-bit processors are supported. Don't try to run Mina on a Raspberry Pi, it won't work !!. Regarding supported operating systems In addition to the official list, it's worth mentioning that a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) installed via WSL2 (Windows Linux Subsystem) allows you to run a validation node and all associated features (Snark Worker, etc.) without any issues as easily as on a native Linux machine. It is also possible to use Docker‚Ñ¢ on Windows to install and run Mina. Regarding machine power / required memory quantity While it is possible to run Mina, according to the official recommendations, on a machine with an 8-core processor and 16GB of RAM, from experience, I strongly recommend a machine with a 16-core CPU and 32GB of RAM.  note I have never been able to produce and broadcast a block on time with a machine equipped with an 8-core processor and 16GB of RAM!!  note Mina does not (yet) leverage the power of graphics cards for validation. Therefore, being a gamer is unnecessary to run a validation node. Only the CPU power is utilized.  Processor Generation Furthermore, the CPU generation also plays a significant role. An older processor, with the same number of cores/threads, will be much less powerful than a recent processor. I recommend a Ryzen 7 7700 which will provide more than sufficient power for block production and Snarks generation.  Regarding cloud providers / VPS / VMs and dedicated servers In addition to the official list provided by Mina, which includes major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean), it is possible to find other providers offering dedicated servers and/or VMs capable of running a validation node. However, it should be noted that the usage policy of these providers may prohibit the use of machines for any blockchain-related purposes, particularly the implementation of a validation node, whether in PoW or PoS.  It is also worth noting that the operating cost of a rented machine or dedicated VM in a cloud environment can be extremely prohibitive and ultimately not profitable. This cost can range from tens of Euros per month (‚Ç¨50-90) for a dedicated server to several hundred Euros per month (‚Ç¨300-800) for the most expensive cloud services (GCP, Azure, AWS, etc.).  danger It is therefore very important to assess the profitability of the project before committing to recurring costs that can be very high. Especially since it is often desirable/necessary to ensure redundancy at the machine level (between 2 and 3 servers), which multiplies costs, to ensure continuous blockchain operation.  Alternative The best alternative in terms of cost, service, blockchain philosophy, and decentralization is of course running a local validation node, not hosted by a third-party provider. For this, any sufficiently powerful computer can suffice provided that this machine can remain connected to the network 24/7. There are sufficiently powerful mini-PCs (Ryzen 7, Core i7/i9) that are very affordable and can run a local validation node from home. Example: the Geekom A5 equipped with a Ryzen 7 5800H and 32GB of RAM (between ‚Ç¨400 and ‚Ç¨450) https://www.geekom.fr/geekom-a5-mini-pc ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Staking guide","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/Wallet owner guide/Staking guide","content":"Staking guide","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Non custodial wallets","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/Wallet owner guide/Non custodial wallets","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"What is a non-custodial wallet ?‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Non custodial wallets","url":"/docs/Wallet owner guide/Non custodial wallets#what-is-a-non-custodial-wallet-","content":" By definition, a &quot;non-custodial&quot; wallet is in contrast to a &quot;custodial&quot; wallet and represents a wallet for which you own the private key and have sole control over.  Buying Mina requires connecting to a trading platform that allows exchanging a currency (Euro, USD, other crypto, etc.) for Minas.  Once you have acquired Minas, they are accessible through the trading platform, and you can potentially engage in trades (short, long) with your tokens on the exchange pairs available on the platform.  info There are virtually no exchange platforms today that allow you to access your private key, which is from the blockchain's perspective the sole proof of ownership of your tokens. Instead, the wallet addresses on exchanges are assigned by the platform, and most of the time, you only have access to the public key of the wallet (which allows you to deposit funds) without ever being granted access to the private key (which enables you to operate, withdraw funds, control, etc.) of your wallet.  CONCLUSION Your tokens stored on an exchange do not belong to you !!! !! Not your key, not your tokens !!  Advantages of Keeping Your Tokens on an Exchange Platform The advantage of storing on an exchange platform (and there is only one!) is the ability to quickly trade (=exchange/buy/sell) your tokens.  Disadvantages of Keeping Your Tokens on an Exchange Platform There are numerous disadvantages to leaving your tokens on a centralized platform:  The first is that it is in complete contradiction with the very principle of blockchain, which is to be decentralized.The second disadvantage is that, theoretically, you have no control over your funds. If the platform goes out of business, you lose 100% of your investments!The third disadvantage concerns staking. Staking in the context of a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain like Mina involves delegating1 your tokens to a trusted validator2 to give them additional chances to produce blocks3 that generate rewards (coinbase4). These rewards are then distributed to the delegators proportionally to the number of delegated mina minus the commission taken by the validator (typically between 0% and 10%, with most applying a 5% rate). When your Minas are stored on a platform, at best, it offers its own staking conditions at high commission rates. However, most platforms simply do not offer staking, depriving you of a significant source of passive income (between 12% and 24% APR).The fourth disadvantage is that a non-custodial wallet does not allow the use of the wallet on specific applications of the blockchain (DApps or zkApps5 in the context of Mina).  1 Staking More information on staking in the dedicated section. Go to üîóStaking Guide  2 Validator A validator is a participants who locks up a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. This collateral serves as a security deposit and ensures that validators have a vested interest in maintaining the integrity of the network. It‚Äôs important to note that funds staked on Mina are not locked up. This means you can re-delegate, un-delegate, transfer, sell, or donate your Mina tokens anytime you want.  3 Blocks Validators take turns creating new blocks and validating transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they have staked. The more cryptocurrency a validator has at stake, the higher the chances they have of being chosen to create a new block.  4 Coinbase Validators are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency for successfully creating and validating blocks. The coinbase is a special transaction in a newly produced block that contains the reward owed to the validator who produced the new block. Currently, the base reward for producing a block on Mina is 720 Mina, to which an additional 720 Mina (supercharged reward) is added if the production slot was won by an unlocked address.  5 zkApps  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"What are the \"non custodial\" mina wallets avaliable ?‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Non custodial wallets","url":"/docs/Wallet owner guide/Non custodial wallets#what-are-the-non-custodial-mina-wallets-avaliable-","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Auro Wallet‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Non custodial wallets","url":"/docs/Wallet owner guide/Non custodial wallets#auro-wallet","content":" official website : https://www.aurowallet.com/    Description (from official website) Available as a browser extension and as a mobile App, Auro Wallet has multiple languages version, perfectly supports Mina Protocol and is completely open-source.
